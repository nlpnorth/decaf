      "Introduction Research on adult-learned second language (L2) has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar [1]–[11]. Of interest here, studies suggest that, despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar, adult learners can approximate native-like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [12]–[15]. However, it is not enough to have attained such native-like levels. Crucially, it is also desirable to retain them, even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2. In fact, substantial periods (months to years) of limited or no exposure following L2 training are not uncommon, and may even be the norm [16]. Such a scenario may be found in different situations, including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [17], [18] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [19]. In the present study, we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar: that is, whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and/or less native-like neural processes (“use it or lose it” [20]), no such changes, or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and/or more native-like processing may be observed. Additionally, we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training, in particular between classroom-like and immersion-like contexts. Previous Research We are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [17], [18], [21]–[24], all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral (performance) outcomes. (Note that we do not consider case studies, purely observational data, or research on L2s acquired by children; for a comprehensive review, see [16]). The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure, mainly on general language skills [17], [18], [21], [23], [24], though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [17], [18] or lexical abilities [22], [23]. These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [17], [18], [22], [23], or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [21], with only one longitudinal study testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [24]. Across the studies, the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training [17], [18], [22], [24] or mixed classroom and immersion training [21], [23], [24]. The training lasted varying lengths of time, apparently usually in the range of a few years, and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels (though not directly measured, except by [24]) prior to the period of limited exposure. Overall, the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following. A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition (loss) of L2 performance or knowledge [17], [18], [21], [23]. Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure, e.g., after a 1-7 month [23] or 6 month delay [21], as well as after 2 years [18], though in one case it was observed only by 3-5 years, and not earlier [17]. some studies suggest that it then appears to level off[17], [18]. Higher levels of proficiency (or exposure) may be associated with less attrition [17], [18], [21], [23] or even with no observed losses [21]. Moreover, one study found no changes at all in performance, across proficiency levels, after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure [22]. Finally, in some cases a gain in performance has been observed: after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study, particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [24], and in another study after 2 years, though only for some abilities, such as listening and reading comprehension [18]. It remains unclear what might explain such gains, which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [24], or to factors related to general maturation, cognitive development, or continued academic training [18]. Digital Humanities Clinics - Leading Dutch Librarians into DH Michiel Cock m.p.cock@vu.nl Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands Lotte Wilms lotte.wilms@kb.nl National Library of the Netherlands, the Netherlands In 2015, an initiative was started ’. At the initial meeting it became apparent that most participants were there to learn more about digital humanities and were not (yet) in the situation where they were able to offer expertise on the subject. On the administrative level, the directors of the libraries participating in the consortium of Dutch academic libraries (UKB) also expressed the wish that librarians become more fluent in DH. A year later, the National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek), and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field. Therefore both institutes joined forces to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians. The two institutes were later joined by the Leiden University Libraries. We see this as the ideal opportunity to provide these educative sessions not only to our own librarians, but also to the academic librarians of other Dutch research libraries. In essence, we want to teach our country’s librarians the ins and outs of DH in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner needed in DH projects. The aim of these clinics is to provide basic methodological competencies and technical skills in DH, for a diverse group of librarians, consisting of both subject and technical librarians with basic technical skills. The content of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students, identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self-directed learning and (perhaps) to automate their daily library work. We are not setting out to turn them into programmers or data crunchers, but want to boost their knowledge level to where . In order to design this curriculum we follow a four step approach with a Working Out Loud-principle (Williams, 2010): Desk research about what being a DH librarian entails (e.g. Hartsell-Gundy et al., 2015; Mulligan, 2016; also see the Zotero library of the LIBER Digital Humanities working group); Identify possible subjects, based on experience, a comparison of existing teaching material related to DH (e.g. The Programming Historian, the Digital Scholarship Training Programme at the British Library and Columbia University's Developing Librarian project) and the TaDiRAH taxonomy of research activities; Get feedback from researchers on possible subjects, based on the knowledge and skills they feel librarians need; Get feedback from librarians on possible subjects, based on already known gaps in their knowledge and skills. we will design the curriculum of clinics. Our plan is to organize a maximum of 6 clinics, each one full day. Each day starts with one or more lectures by researchers, that address the conceptual knowledge needed. The afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills, following the Library Carpentry model as closely as possible. By having researchers provide the lecture sessions, we hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to provide access to a network within and across universities. With these clinics, we hope to initiate a stream of DH activities in Dutch universities, making access to support easier for new digital scholars. The poster at DH2017 will present the curriculum, its position in the international context and offer the lessons learned from both the design process and the first clinics. We welcome discussion about our efforts and the possibilities of applying this in other contexts. Education and early loves Byron received his early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School, and in August 1799 entered the school of Dr. William Glennie, in Dulwich. [17] Placed under the care of a Dr. Bailey, he was encouraged to exercise in moderation but not restrain himself from \"violent\" bouts in an attempt to overcompensate for his deformed foot. His mother interfered with his studies, often withdrawing him from school, with the result that he lacked discipline and his classical studies were neglected. In 1801, he was sent to Harrow, where he remained until July 1805. [6] An undistinguished student and an unskilled cricketer, he did represent the school during the very first Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord's in 1805. [19] His lack of moderation was not restricted to physical exercise. Byron fell in love with Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at school, [6] and she was the reason he refused to return to Harrow in September 1803. His mother wrote, \"He has no indisposition that I know of but love, desperate love, the worst of all maladies in my opinion. In short, the boy is distractedly in love with Miss Chaworth.\" [6] In Byron's later memoirs, \"Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings.\" [20] Byron finally returned in January 1804, [6] to a more settled period which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys, which he recalled with great vividness: \"My school friendships were with me passions (for I was always violent).\" [21] The most enduring of those was with John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare — four years Byron's junior — whom he was to meet unexpectedly many years later in Italy (1821). [22] His nostalgic poems about his Harrow friendships, Childish Recollections (1806), express a prescient \"consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him.\" [23] Letters to Byron in the John Murray archive contain evidence of a previously unremarked if short-lived romantic relationship with a younger boy at Harrow, John Thomas Claridge. John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare Ah! Sure some stronger impulse vibrates here, Which whispers friendship will be doubly dear To one, who thus for kindred hearts must roam, And seek abroad, the love denied at home. The following autumn, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, [24] where he met and formed a close friendship with the younger John Edleston. About his \"protégé\" he wrote, \"He has been my almost constant associate since October, 1805, when I entered Trinity College. His voice first attracted my attention, his countenance fixed it, and his manners attached me to him for ever.\" In his memory Byron composed Thyrza, a series of elegies. [25] In later years, he described the affair as \"a violent, though pure love and passion\". This statement, however, needs to be read in the context of hardening public attitudes toward homosexuality in England and the severe sanctions (including public hanging) against convicted or even suspected offenders. [26] The liaison, on the other hand, may well have been \"pure\" out of respect for Edleston's innocence, in contrast to the (probably) more sexually overt relations experienced at Harrow School. [27] Byron spent three years at Trinity College, engaging in sexual escapades, boxing, horse riding and gambling. [28] Also while at Cambridge he formed lifelong friendships with men such as John Cam Hobhouse, who initiated him into the Cambridge Whig Club, which endorsed liberal politics, [28] and Francis Hodgson, a Fellow at King's College, with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life. Emperor Norton Joshua Abraham Norton (c. 1818 – January 8, 1880), known as Emperor Norton, was a citizen of San Francisco, California, who in 1859 proclaimed himself \"Norton I, Emperor of the United States\". He later expanded his pretense by claiming to be \"Protector of Mexico\" as well. Born in England, Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa. After the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848, he sailed west, arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849. Norton initially made a living as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice. After he lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, Norton's public prominence faded. He reemerged in September 1859, laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States. He had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him; nevertheless, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented. Though some considered him insane or eccentric, citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations, such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland, and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay. Long after his death, similar structures were built in the form of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube, and there have been campaigns to rename the bridge \"The Emperor Norton Bridge\". On January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont (now Grant) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment. Nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral. Norton has been immortalized as the basis of characters in the literature of writers Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, Christopher Moore, Morris and Goscinny, Selma Lagerlöf, and Neil Gaiman. Norton I, Emperor of the United States, photograph, c. 1871 – 72 Declares himself emperor Emperor Joshua Norton, in full military regalia, circa 1880 or earlier By 1859, Norton had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States. On September 17, 1859, he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city, proclaiming himself \"Emperor of these United States\": At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S. F., Cal., declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U. S.; and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in Musical Hall, of this city, on the 1st day of Feb. next, then and there to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring, and thereby cause confidence to exist, both at home and abroad, in our stability and integrity. — NORTON I, Emperor of the United States. The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin. Norton would later add \"Protector of Mexico\" to this title. Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year \"reign\" over America. One of Norton's undated proclamations In his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state. After assuming absolute control over the country, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree formally abolishing the United States Congress. In it, Norton observed: ... fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled. Norton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to \"remedy the evil complained of\". In an imperial decree the following month, Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress: WHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished; WHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with; NOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott, the Command-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress. What'd you do Sabrina? Nothing. I left the phone in my bedroom last night, and so I'm grounded from the phone. It was an accident. You guys are always in trouble. What's up with that? Mom's a bitch.

Okay cool, cause she had to go bowling in the morning. Talk to Melanie's mom. Her mom would know. I'll have Melanie call you. Oh. Her mom call you — Right, right. Her mom wouldn't lie. Right, Melanie will call me to confirm your lie. Melanie lies but — You'll get a hold of her first. I know how that works. No, Melanie's mom. I thought Melanie didn't have a phone. But I'm supposed to call Melanie's mom. I didn't want you to have her phone number. Yeah, another lie. Remember? That was a long time ago. Now I'm supposed to re- — A- and I'm supposed to trust you every time you tell the truth. But how am I supposed to know when you're telling the truth? That was a joke. That was a joke. Yeah, and I'm supposed to read your mind and know what you're joking about. No but, it was a joke. You know Kendra, y- — I don't know how many times I gotta tell you, once you lie, once you lie — Are they having a carwash? You lose th- complete trust. No. Yeah they are. Yeah that's what it is a — We should have a carwash there. Carwash and a bakesale. They're not getting any people though. Mm. Hot out. What's that supposed to be? They're making it into something. You're not going anywhere for a while. It's a bookstore. Really? God, I didn't spend the night, that's what makes me so mad, I'm grounded for nothing. I was home all night last night, I came home and told you. And even my cuffs and everything's on my bed. So stupid. Next time if I leave in the morning, I'll wake you up. Mom I'm awake now, I'm leaving. Well you woke me up last night, to tell me Kim wasn't spending the night. I don't know why . You guys wake me up every time I'm trying to take a little nap. What if we are awake? I was tired this morning. So much fun. My hair looks like a mess. I left it in a ponytail, I didn't even have time to take a shower. I think if I spent the night I would've took a shower. All I need is your signature so I can play the volleyball. On the volleyball team. No. No. Why? It's just volleyball. It's f- like on Saturdays and Wednesdays. It's for church. It's fun. You have practice every Wednesday. Yeah but, not at uh — This is at six thirty. I don't care. And Susan's going to it too. Mm. Who cut the grass? Marlena did it. Marlena did it a long time ago, but it hasn't been watered. It's dying. I know. Gonna rip your purse. I know. See if I spent the night mom, you'd think I'd still be in my uniform? I know she's — J- she — See now she's trying to think of ways to cover her tracks. I know what you're doing. Seen this before. I'm hungry. Shit. I love your jeans. Cause I wanted to go to the bathroom when you're done. Anyways, they were not. Did you get a Sawzall? Yes, it's right here. Oh. I got the blades. They're right here. Do you remember the uh, program on TV, about Hantavirus? About what virus? Hantavirus. Hutter? What's that about? I don't re- – I don't remember. It's the one from the dead mice. Oh, yeah. Is it, is it all over now? Is it for real now? Is it in here? Is it in the United States now? They said, they already determined it was in like eighteen different states. What? So? The Hantavirus. What, what are you g- — Well — So what're you getting at? That insulation out there with the mice shit in it? Did you just wash — Yes. Really bothers me. I kn- — Oh oh I know. I mean that's the thing I thought of too. Well, it's all packed up in garbage bags now. I didn't even touch it. Used a hoe, stuffed it. I didn't touch anything. Don't touch anything yellow. Okay? Not with your gloves or anything. Find something else to pick it up with. Mhm. Did you — did you put it in a trash bag? I took that brown trash thing, and tucked a bag in it. And then I put them in there. Squashed em down. We need a — Do you have any sharp objects on you? No. Keys? No I need like a little pin or something. You have a pencil? You have anything in your hair? No. Fuck. What do you have to hit? See this is the little - Oh. Oh oh. Cool? Okay. Alright. See, it was just slow. Okay. This is me? Is this me? Yeah. Yeah. Jennifer. Oh. That's right. There you go thinking again. Smart ass. Smart ass. Alright. Wow. Who took over uh ... Oh. They got North America. But not for long. Oh, my God. Oh my God, did you see that? Because player thr- player three is aggressive, so he's gonna like go for everything. How do you know? Did I make him aggressive? Yeah, you made him aggressive, so, he's gonna like, try to tear everything up now. Um, that's pretty well, like secure right there, so maybe — That's me. Oh fuck. Wow, he wiped my ass out. Ah, you suck. Watch this. Loser. What else can we do tomorrow? Besides go to the movies, t-? Go out to dinner? I'm so not hungry right now, it's hard for me to think about food. Alright. I'd like to go out to dinner though. Think we can find a hot dog? Yeah, that's a good idea. That's an excellent idea. There you go thinking again again. There you go thinking again. I'm gonna whip your butt. You think so, hunh? Yeah. Un-unh. That's all I get? That's me, right? Yeah you get a percentage of the amount of countries you own, and then, for continents you get another set amount. So can I get something on this bad boy? Yeah. See? So I hit okay? Yeah. Hit okay. See you got one of each kind of card. Excellent. Oh okay. So I get ... So you got ten, looks like sixteen. Sixteen? Who you gonna trounce on? That's you up there, too, right there, you know. That's me right there, too. Oh yeah. Um ... When w- you take over another person, you take a — you get, their cards. The MSG in that Chinese food really got me high for a little bit. Does MSG affect you? No. Not really. It affects my mother. Gives her headaches. Are you gonna attack over there? I don't know. Thirteen. That leaves me with thirteen. I wanna fortify. You can't move those to there, because they're not touching. W- w- well that's kind of bogus. Nun-unh. Maybe I'll move em right there. Done. Done. Oh fuck. Oh. Who's this guy? Player six. Yakutsk. Look at that. See if I have any cards. Oh, I got a set. You know what I think, I think the first time that it does the card mode, it takes a long time. Yeah. Yeah. You remember the last time, that's what happened. Yeah. You remember? Yeah. Look at you being smart. I'm not smart? You're stupid. Don't call me stupid. Mm. Alright. Look at you with the uh little armies down here. Big armies. Trying to — trying to win. I got big armies, buddy. Trying to conquer the world. I'm gonna conquer — I'm gonna conquer you. Probably. Ooh. He's giving you some problems over there. He is indeed. Go for that one. Go into Europe. Get Europe. Oops. You won't attack me yet. I think I'll stop there. Hmm. I only have uh, that many cards, so ... How many cards you have? You only have two. Just two. So you can't have a set. When do you get — h- — when do you get cards though? I don't understand that.

You asshole. Two — hmm. I'm tired. We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 22-506, Biden versus Nebraska. General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: COVID-19 is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history and it has caused enormous disruption and economic distress. Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been unable to pay their debts. two secrataries across two administrations invoked the HEROES Act . But, if that forbearance ends without further relief, it's undisputed that defaults and delinquencies will surge above pre-pandemic levels. So Secretary Cardona again invoked the HEROES Act . The states ask this Court to deny that vital relief to millions of Americans, but they lack standing to seek that result. They principally assert harm to a separate legal person, MOHELA, that could sue in its own name but has chosen not to do so, and the states' asserted harms to their tax revenues are self-inflicted and indirect. The states' bare disagreement with this policy is not the sort of concrete injury that Article III demands. On the merits, the states say the Act doesn't authorize the Secretary to ever forgive loan principal. But the Secretary's interpretation of this text is not just a plausible reading; it's the best reading. Congress expressly authorized the Secretary to waive or modify any Title IV provision in emergencies to provide financial relief to borrowers. Loan forgiveness is a paradigmatic form of debt relief, and the Secretary acted within the heartland of his authority and in line with the central purpose of the HEROES Act in providing that relief here. To apply the major questions doctrine to override that clear text would deny borrowers critical relief that Congress authorized and the Secretary deemed essential. I welcome the Court's questions. General, is this a waiver, or is it a modification? It's both a waiver and a modification, Justice Thomas. This appears at JA 261. That was the decision document that the Secretary signed where he said, I hereby issue waivers and modifications of multiple provisions under Title IV of the student loan program. And then that language was repeated in the Federal Register notice that actually implemented that program and constitutes the final agency action that the states are challenging here. Well, could you explain then -- in -- in -- in other provisions, there is express language as to cancellation, and, of course, there isn't here. So would you take a minute ? Of course. So the Secretary identified various provisions in Title IV that govern the terms and conditions of student loans and also govern discharge and cancellation in other circumstances, as your question suggested. And I think the straightforward way to think about how the verbs map onto the Secretary's action is that he waived elements of those provisions that contain eligibility requirements for discharge and cancellation that are inapplicable under this program and then modified the provisions to contain the limitations that he had announced as part and parcel of announcing this loan forgiveness. Now you had suggested that there's no express statement in the HEROES Act to discharge loan principal, and that's true, but the relevant and operative language here is the provision that says the Secretary is empowered to waive or modify any Title IV provision, and so the HEROES Act isn't enumerating any of the various forms of relief that have long been authorized and implemented under this statute. I don't think anything can be read into the fact that there's no express reference to particular forms of relief because Congress was trying to broadly cover the field and ensure that the Secretary had the tools to respond to the national emergency with whatever relief might be necessitated. But, in an opinion we had a few years ago by Justice Scalia, he talked about what the word \"modify\" means, and he said modified in our view connotes moderate change. He said it might be good English to say that the French Revolution modified the status of the French nobility, but only because there's a figure of speech called understatement and a literary device known as sarcasm. We're talking about half a trillion dollars and 43 million Americans. How does that fit under the normal understanding of \"modifying\"? So, of course, I recognize that in MCI, Justice Scalia's opinion adopted a narrower understanding of that term, but I don't read that opinion to set forth a universal meaning of \"modify, \"no matter the statutory context. And, here, of course, we have a broader phrase, \"waive or modify.\" It's undisputed and the states aren't contesting that the ordinary meaning of \"waive\" means to eliminate an obligation in its entirety. And I think, if you look at that phrase in the context of the statute, that means that \"modify\" has to mean making a change up to the point of wholesale elimination. It would be really strange for Congress to say you can eliminate obligations altogether or tweak them just the littlest bit, but you can't do anything in between. Well, but it's \"waive \"particular regulatory or statutory provisions. That's right. That to me suggests a much more focused use of the word. Well, it's \"waive or modify\" paired with the authority to do that with respect to any Title IV provision. So I think that that is the – It doesn't say waive -- modify or waive loan balances. To Feel Happier, We Have to Resolve to the Life We Evolved to Live By Arash Javanbakht #science #health #advice #food #research #history When humans had to hunt for food, they had to move more. Sedentary lifestyles have made humans far less active than they need to be. “Hunting Wooly Mammoth” by http://cloudinary.com is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 When we have to give a talk to a group of people, we feel anxious and experience the bodily fear responses that do not make sense now: The system is not meant to function in this safe context. As a psychiatrist specialized in anxiety and trauma, I often tell my patients and students that we have to see it in the context where it evolved. Ten thousand years ago, if another human frowned at us, chances were high one of us would be dead in a couple minutes. In the tribal life of our ancestors, if other tribe members did not like you, you would be dead, or exiled and dead. Biological evolution is very slow, but civilization, culture, society and technology evolve relatively fast. It takes around a million years for evolutionary change to happen in a species, and people have been around for about 200,000 years. Each of us, however, sees drastic changes in our lifestyle and environment over a matter of a few years. Let’s compare the life for which this body and brain has evolved with the life we live, from my perspective as a scientist and a physician. What we eat We evolved in a context of scarcity, and had to walk or run for miles and scavenge to find food; we had to work for it. we did not know when . we were better off . Food was not quick to digest, stomachs also had to work hard for it: meat, fruits, vegetables, seeds and nuts. None of these contained “easy” sugary calories. The body that was prone to starvation, evolved to eat it all when available, and store it, and be stingy in its use. But now, food is just a few feet away, and we can easily consume thousands of calories in one serving. Fatty food, which required days and miles , is now right there in the fridge or at the McDonald's. It is like giving full fridge privileges to your Labrador. Easy calories like soda and candies provide a very large amount of energy in a very short amount of time and confuse the whole system. We end up fat and fatigued. How we move Our ancestors had to be active to survive in the wild. They had to walk miles a day, and were frequently involved in high intensity physical activity: moving heavy objects, climbing, fighting, chasing a prey or fleeing predators. This body did not evolve . A contemporary American may only walk a few dozen steps to the car, drive to work, ride the elevator to the office, walk a few dozen steps back to the car, get drive-thru food, then be back on the couch. Suboptimal muscle use leads to weaker joint support, and weird postures cause pain. Pain leads to reduced activity, more obesity and weaker muscles; then comes opioid epidemic, overuse of pain medications, and back surgeries for all! [...] What can we do to feel better? When we adopt a pet, we learn about their normal environment, activity level and nutrition. Isn’t it interesting that we do not apply that to the animal we live in? To feel normal, we should live normal, and a human’s normal life is that for which she or he has evolved. So I believe the first step is to understand ourselves, and why we do what we do, and desire what we desire. that is because the human animal had to do so . Such understanding brings empathy, reduces judgment and helps us get creative. Keep away the high-calorie sugary food. I tell my patients: do not buy it, or if you do, buy in small amounts. Try to eat what you were evolved to eat. Know the body is lazy, because it wants to save precious energy. The drag of going to the gym may be because of that. Also know that this body would be much happier when it is regularly, and highly active. We know that exercise is not only helpful for cardiovascular and bodily health, but also reduces anxiety. I ask all my patients to commit to some level of exercise, as part of their treatment plan. And it does not have to be treadmill or gym. Whatever rocks your boat: yoga, boxing, walking, running up the stairs at work, doing 20 push-ups, 20 sit-ups and 20 squats a day, or dancing to a TV ad; whatever makes your heart pound faster. Other bonuses come with exercise: getting sun exposure or to know your neighbor when walking the dog, making new friends (or a date) at the gym, feeling better about yourself, and being more attractive to yourself and others. All these factors lift your mood. Do not feel disappointed if you did not lose weight, it’s not the only goal. Other benefits are abundant and even more important: increased strength and energy, cardiovascular and joint health, improved mood, etc. When it comes to sleep, changing behavior works. Here are some tips for better sleep: avoid late caffeine, bright screens (including your phone – Facebook can wait), and use your bed only for sleep and sex. Finally, you may need a regular dose of healthy and safe exposure to real-life excitement, and a little bit of fear. Bottom line: If we treated our body the way responsible dog owners treated their dog, we would live a much happier life. The Beast I was thirteen. It was spring, the barren time in March when you can not be sure if it is really warmer, but you are so desperate for change that you tell yourself the mud at the edge of the sidewalk is different from winter mud and you are sure that the smell of wet soil has suddenly a bit of the scent of summer rains, of grass and drowned earthworms. And it has, because it is spring and inside the ground something is stirring. I was wearing a yellow linen dress which my mother had picked out and which I therefore disliked although I knew it flattered me. My shoes were white and I was concentrating on keeping them out of the mud. My father and I were going to mass — my mother did not go; she was Protestant. My father put his hand on top of my hair, his palm on my head, and I could feel the bone of my skull and my skin and his hot palm, so dry and strong. When I was a little girl, he did that often, and called me Muscles. He had not called me Muscles or put his hand on my head for a long time. I could not help arching my back a little, I wanted to push against his hand like a cat but the instinct that comes with being thirteen, the half-understood caution that makes a girl timid, or wild, the shyness told me to just walk. I wanted to feel the rough edge of the pocket of his coat against my cheek, but I was too tall. I wanted to be seven again, and safe. But I still wanted to push against his hand and put my hand in his pocket and steal the leather palmed glove, that secret animal. Instead I went into the church, took a Bulletin, dipped my finger in Holy Water and genuflected. The inside of the church smelled like damp wood and furniture polish, not alive at all. My father took off his coat and draped it over the edge of the pew and when I came back from communion I stole his glove. The paper taste of the wafer was still in my mouth and I took a deep breath of the leather. It smelled like March. We walked back through the school . There were two classes of each grade, starting at the sixth and going down to the first. The hall ended in a T and we went left through the gym, walked underneath the bleachers and stood next to the side door. It was dark under the bleachers. My father was a young man, thirty-five, younger because he liked to be outside, to play softball on Saturday and to take my mother and me camping on vacation. He stood . I thought of bacon and eggs, toast with peach jam out of the jar. I was so hungry. The space under the bleachers was secret and dark. There were things in the shadows; a metal pail, a mop, rags. Next to the door was a tall wrought-iron candle holder — the kind that stood at either end of the altar. There was no holder and the end was jagged. On the floor was a wrapper from a French Chew. They were sold at eighth-grade basketball games on Friday nights. The light from the door made the shadows under the bleachers darker, the long space stretched far away. I heard the rain and the faint rustle of paper and smelled damp concrete. I did not go near my father but kept my hand in my pocket, feeling the soft leather glove. There was a rustling on the concrete and the drizzle of soft rain. I wondered if anyone ever went back under the bleachers, if there were crickets or mice there. The rustling might have been mice. I wished the rain would stop. I wanted to go home. I made noises with my heels but they were too loud so I stopped. Something else clicked and I tried to see what it was but couldn’t see anything. It wasn’t as loud as my heels. My father cleared his throat, looking out the door. I imagined a man down there in the dark, an escaped convict or a madman. It had nearly stopped raining. In fifteen minutes we would be home and my mother would fry eggs. I heard a noise like paper. My father heard it, too, but he pretended not to, at least he didn’t turn his head. And there was a heavier sound, a rasp, like a box pulled over concrete. I looked at my father but he didn’t turn his head. I wished he would turn his head. There was a click again and the rustle, and I could not think of what it could be. I had no explanation for the particular combination of sounds. No doubt there was, some two things that happened to be making noises at the same time. Once in a fever I heard thousands of birds outside my window and I was terrified that they would fling themselves through the glass and attack me, but it was only the rain on the eaves. Chapter Two: Master Lunre My father’s actions were largely incomprehensible to me, guided by his own secret and labyrinthine calculations. He dwelt in another world, a world of intrigue, bargains, contracts and clandestine purchases of land all over the island. He was in many ways a world in himself, whole as a sphere. No doubt his decisions were perfectly logical in his own eyes — even the one that prompted him, a patriotic islander, to bring me a tutor from Bain: Master Lunre, an Olondrian. The day began . We stood by the gate. Jom, grown taller and broad in the shoulders, moaned gently to himself. We scanned the deep blue valley for the first sign of the company, but before we saw them we heard the children shouting: “A yellow man!” A yellow man! We glanced at one another in confusion. My mother bit her lower lip; Jom gave a groan of alarm. At first I thought the children meant my father, whose golden skin, the color of the night-monkey’s pelt, was a rarity in the islands; but certainly the children of Tyom were familiar with my father, and would never have greeted a council-member with such ill-mannered yells. Then I remembered the only “yellow man” I had ever seen, an Olondrian wizard and doctor who had visited Tyom in my childhood, who wore two pieces of glass on his eyes, attached to his ears with wires, and roamed the hills of Tinimavet, cutting bits off the trees. I have since learned that that doctor wrote a well-received treatise, On the Medicinal Properties of the Juice of the Young Coconut, and died a respected man in his native city of Deinivel; but at the time I felt certain he had returned with his sack of tree-cuttings. “There they are,” said Pavit, the head house-servant, in a strained voice. And there they were: a chain of riders weaving among the trees. My father’s plaited umbrella appeared, his still, imposing figure, and beside him another man, tall and lean, astride an island mule. The hectic screams of the children preceded the company into the village. As they approached I saw that my father’s face was shining with pride, and his bearing had in it a new hauteur, like that of the old island kings. The man who rode beside him, looking uncomfortable with his long legs, kept his gaze lowered and fixed between the ears of his plodding mule. He was not yellow, but very pale brown, the color of raw cashews; he had silver hair, worn cropped close to the skull so that it resembled a cap. He was not the leaf-collecting doctor, but an altogether strange man, with silver eyebrows in his smooth face and long fine-knuckled hands. As he dismounted in front of the house I heard my mother whispering: “Protect us, God with the Black-and-White Tail, from that which is not of this earth.” My father dismounted from his mule and strutted toward us, grinning. I thought I caught an odor off him, of fish, sea-sickness and sweat. We knelt and stared down at the bald ground. Then we stood. Wikinews interviews meteorological experts on Cyclone Phalin File photo of interviewee David Titley. Image: David Titley. Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h, as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength? Yes, all tropical cyclones are driven by high heat content waters. Once a storm moves over any appreciably sized piece of land, the moisture source is removed and the storm begins to dissipate. As of the last advisory, T C Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland, headed on a northwest track. That is a Category 3 storm. The forecast is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours. However, there will be very heavy rains and flooding along its path. Yes, it will loose strength steadily . This occurs for two reasons: As it moves over land, it is cut off from the source of energy driving the storm [which is] the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface; Increased friction - the ocean surface is much, much smoother than the land surface. Tropical cyclones are sustained by a form of energy called latent heat, which is released by moisture evaporated from the ocean that condenses to form rain. this energy source is cut-off and they rapidly lose strength . Yes, the Cyclone is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land. Cyclones gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land. In the mean time, much stronger friction over land quickly reduces their strength. Yes. All tropical cyclones lose strength once they make landfall. However, they can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides, and river flooding. Phailin's winds will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland. Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore it will immediately begin to lose strength. However, and this is important, it still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty.

Is the Indian government well prepared to deal with this cyclone? I have not followed that aspect of the societal response for the present storm. However, historically, there have been several events that should cause a societal response. Hopefully, we all learn from past mistakes. The history of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable, with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed, millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US$ 10 billion. I don't have enough information to answer this question, one way or the other. From all the press reports that I have read, the Indian government appears to have taken the threat of Cyclone Phailin very seriously indeed. The government has been much more pro-active . The forecasts of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate. Mandatory mass evacuations have been carried out. Unfortunately, extensive property damage is bound to occur even with the best preparation. My knowledge of the responsiveness of the Indian government to this storm is purely from the cyber space. I heard that they orchestrated the largest people evacuation to a natural disaster in Indian history. This shall be applauded given the size and strength of Phailin. I visited the damaged area of the 1999 storm near Bhubaneshwar in the summer of 2012 for an invited symposium and summer school on tropical cyclones [...] sponsored by the Indian government. the evacuation is certainly necessary and essential . I cannot comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone. However, the news reports (BBC etc.) were very encouraging . Water is the main killer in these storms. From all reports that I have seen, the government was well prepared for this cyclone. For this question I don't know the 'preparedness' of the Indian gov't to deal with this. Wikinews interviews Mario J. Lucero and Isabel Ruiz of Heaven Sent Gaming General questions What is Heaven Sent Gaming? Heaven Sent Gaming is basically me and Isabel, I'm Mario J. Lucero. And, I'm Isabel Ruiz. And, together we formed this thing, it's sort of like an entertainment team. We started it basically, because I wanted to - I wanted to work with Isabel on a lot of projects that we had going on together. We were coming with comics, like, left and right, we were coming up with things like Karis, in high school she came up with that one, I came up with an individual story called Thad's World Destruction and, she wanted to illustrate it, and so, that's the way we ended up doing it. Yep, we like to just make our own original content, and, yep, that's what we wanted to do. How did you two meet? We met back in high school. In this private, tiny-tiny private school of 50 students. But, before hand in middle school, I kept on hearing about this guy named Mario, and he kept on hearing about me, this girl named Isabel. And, everyone, all of our friends and all of our acquaintances would say, \"Hey, you'd get along with him really well.\" So before hand I kinda knew about him, but I never met him. And one of our friends, our common friends, he introduced us during study hall, and we just kind of hit it off from there. It's true. Who else is involved in this project? Currently, we're in talks with people. There's Jeff [Drake], who is behind the camera. Right now, yeah, he's helping us right now. We're talking about doing some individual web series, video series. Josh Kindig, he's coming on board, he has some ideas for that too, he wants to take over \"aywv\" and do more gaming news. There's of course Jason, who is our editor and he's the one who writes dD. Digital Domain What is your purpose behind this venture? Well, back in college, back in Collins College, Isabel and I, we had met like she said at Sandia View Academy, and we went off to college together in Arizona; and ... (how do I best explain this?) Basically, she came up with a few class projects, and I came up with a few class projects; we started working with a few of our friends, and colleagues and whatnot. Those included Drew Cass, Devin Thurlow, people like that. She had several ideas, and she used to draw a lot in the sketchbook, she used to have this thick sketchbook that she used to carry around with her everywhere, where she'd draw these different characters and whatnot; and she was always really shy to show that off to people, and I wanted to help her show that stuff, and I wanted to bring it out to the world. I was a writer, and she always liked my writings, so I was like, let's just get both of our things together, and let's get this done. And for me, what I want the purpose to be, is to inspire people. To bring a little more light to the world is what I want, out of all of this. And what was the verse that we have? First Corinthians 9:25? Yes. Yeah, exactly. We just want to be able to bring, like she said, bring light into the entertainment and into the media industry, specifically is what we do. Yeah. August 19, 1975 Dear Hannah: We are back from Europe, having been to London then to Mallorca and back to London. It was hot, as you yourself will know from your stay in Switzerland and the newspapers -- London was sweltering and the parks are not green, probably for the first time in two hundred years. Martha greatly enjoyed our stay in Mallorca at the villa of our friend Vane Ivanovic. Luncheons and dinners were crowded with guests, but in the evenings she played bridge constantly and gossiped with our hostess. Vane himself presented me with five hundred pages of his memoirs and, I cut and edited the work: I am on holiday the inveterate and proverbial busman. I wrote only about 2000 words on my novel, but I've finished now five chapters. It is romantic, and sad, which is to say, interesting experience recollected. At Vane's villa I met the Prince of Spain, Alphonso, who is the son of King Alphonso's deaf and mute son (the second one). The Prince is married to Franco's granddaughter, a marvelously beautiful and seriously educated girl of twenty-six who is quite wasted on this royalist. I thought that in Mallorca I had at least escaped my duties as Regent, but Alphonso asked me about bilingual education for Puerto Ricans and beraded the Americans for suppressing their \"fourteen million Latins.\" He told me that Dean Acheson told him that Harry Truman denied Spain Marshall Plan aid because Truman was a Protestant. he replied that this was a superficial answer. Isn't it marvelous how ? It is a quiet summer in New York, especially as there isn't such news except that of the city's financial troubles. Odd, though, that there is none of the hectic spending and living here that seems to obtain amongst moneyed people and even the middle classes in London, where I was amazed to discover that the shops are full and places of entertainment are crowed. I don't know what to make of it -- the idea that it shows the last days of Rome doesn't quite strike me as right. The pound will surely fallto $ 2.00 -- I've already started to discount our assets in London, although the operating revenues and profits there on our scientific books and journals are holding up quite apart from inflation in prices. What's happening in New York willhappen in some other cities around the world, I am convinced: Milan or Rome, Paris, Jakarta, and so forth. We miss you, Hannah, but we know that you must be getting some real rest. Will you go to Israel at the end of your stay? What are the dates of Aberdeen? Is there anything you need? I've seen the doctor twice , and he's convinced that I just missed an \"episode,\" I feel quite well now and I am watching myself. I lost twelve pounds. I've promised Dr. Steiner that I will not travel at all, andon humid days I stay at home and work and read. I'm rereading Johnson's Lives of The Poets, a splendid work that proves that the best criticism is based on sensibility to art and prejudice to behavior. Mary is working away on her novel. I've been in touch with her briefly -- of course I saw her . I am publishing the Chiaramonte book in the Spring. Mary has provided a preface. How does The Life of the Mind proceed? I look forward to going over manuscript with you when you return. We were, interrupted . Hannah, Martha and I send you love and greetings and we hope that the summer ends with lazy leisurely days for you. We shall be seeing you soon. Yours, Bill Parents prosecuted after homeopathic treatment leads to daughter's death Friday, May 8, 2009 Thomas Sam, 42, and his wife Manju Sam, 36, from Sydney, Australia, are undergoing trial for manslaughter by gross negligence for the death of their nine-month-old child, Gloria. She died from infection caused by severe eczema after they shunned effective conventional medical treatments for homeopathy, a form of alternative medicine that has been described as pseudoscience. Articles in peer-reviewed academic journals including Social Science & Medicine have characterized homeopathy as a form of quackery. An example of severe eczema. Image: Jambula. Gloria developed severe eczema at the age of four months and the parents were advised to send the child to a skin specialist. Thomas Sam, a practising homeopath, instead decided to treat his daughter himself. His daughter's condition deteriorated, to the point that the baby spent all her energy . By the end, Gloria's eczema was so severe Gloria also became unable to move her legs. Mr. Tedeschi also told the court that, over the last five months of her life, \"Gloria's eczema played a devastating role in her overall health and it is asserted by the Crown that both her parents knew this and discussed it with each other.\" However, despite their child's severe illness, and her lack of improvement, the Sams continued to shun conventional medical treatment, instead seeking help from other homeopaths and naturopaths. Gloria temporarily improved during the rare times they used conventional treatments, but they soon dropped them in favour of homeopathy, and she consistently worsened. Allegedly, Thomas' sister pleaded with him to send Gloria to a conventional medical doctor, but he replied \"I am not able to do that\". The parents are also accused . Gloria was finally taken to the emergency department shortly before her death. By this time, \"her skin was weeping, her body malnourished and her corneas melting\", according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Tom Molomby, SC, said that, they should be declared not guilty due to cultural differences. Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine which treats patients with massively diluted forms of substances that, if given to a healthy person undiluted, would cause symptoms similar to the disease. Typical treatments take the dilutions, with ritualised shaking between each step of the dilution, past the level where any molecules of the original substance are likely to remain; for homeopathic treatments to work, basic well-understood concepts in chemistry and physics would have to be wrong. There is no evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebo for any condition. Australian children suffering from iodine deficiency Thursday, February 23, 2006 Almost half of all Australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient, researchers say. A new study documenting iodine nutritional status in Australian school children has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation. The report's authors say iodine deficiency is \"the sleeper health issue in Australia\", and potentially a very serious one. The results of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week, revealed that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient. The report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised. They say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders. A cross-sectional survey of 1709 schoolchildren - aged 8–10 years, from 88 schools - was carried out in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, between July 2003 and December 2004. Tasmania was excluded from the study - where an voluntary iodine fortification program using iodised salt in bread, is ongoing. The authors say the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population. They call for \"urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia.\" Most iodine in food comes from seafood, milk and iodised salt. Professor Cres Eastman, Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study, and Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, says it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine. Iodine deficiency can lead to serious health problems including brain damage, stunted growth and deafness. Professor Eastman says manufacturers could easily remedy the situation by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries. \"I suspect they won't do that on a voluntary basis, we've tried so far and haven't succeeded, so we've convinced the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand | that all salt should be iodised,\" he said. The report says the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry, where chlorine-containing sanitisers have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers. Iodine released from these chemicals into milk has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades, but is now declining. Another contributory factor has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt used in foods. The report states that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods. Professor Eastman says iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation that all salt be iodised. He says authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt. \"The effects of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe and when . So if we go to the pregnant woman, she doesn't get enough iodine, she won't make enough thyroid hormone, and the foetus won't get the amount of thyroid hormone it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain, so you'll then see consequences being loss of IQ, learning difficulties, hearing difficulties and other neurological problems,\" Professor Eastman said. \"brain development won't be completed and they won't grow normally, and the problem will be that you will develop a goiter and your thyroid won't function as well , so that may have all sorts of pernicious effects upon normal function in life.\" More than two billion people around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency, and yet the problem is easily fixed. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that every country should iodise all edible salt. The most well known effects of IDD are visible goiter and cretinism, a condition characterised by severe brain damage occurring in very early life. WHO say Iodine deficiency is the world’s most prevalent, yet easily preventable, cause of brain damage. Professor Eastman said he is alarmed by what they found. \"Pregnant women in Australia are getting about half as much as what they require on a daily basis. So that alarms me, because there's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children born in this country,\" he said. \"If Iodine deficiency is serious you lose 15 IQ points, on average. There shouldn't be anyone suffering from iodine deficiency in a developed country like Australia.\" Lydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand, says they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year. She says the issue is complicated and will take time to get right. We need to \"make sure there's sufficient iodine added into the food supply, to help those people with a deficiency. But at the other end of the scale we've got to make sure the people who eat a lot of food - we all know the teenage boy who comes home from school and eats a whole loaf of bread - that those people don't get too much and get overdose,\" Ms Bauchtman said. \"One of the reasons that iodine is going down is because people are taking that good healthy eating message and not adding salt during cooking.\" Senior researcher Mu Li, of the University of NSW's school of public health, said \"it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient, putting the next generation of children born in this country at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency.\" Good evening everybody and welcome to Beyond the Mat! The Beyond the Mat show after WrestleMania. Well, it happened folks. WrestleMania happened, Raw happened, Smackdown happened, everything fucking happened. Holy shit, there is so much to talk about this week, and we’re going to cover it all, the best we can. I’m your host as always, Dave, and I am joined by Alex. Howdy! We were supposed to have word from Carl. We don’t know where , so I’ll just take that as a – he’s one of the people that is cutting his wrists ! Those of you who take offense to that, fuck off and – What did, uh, what’s his name – what did, uh, our, our, wh-, the one that always is dressed up like Undertaker on Facebook? Yeah, he did the exact same thing, he folded his clothes and put ’em on or something. Yeah, I thought I saw that picture, what does it look like, what is he – what is he doing? I’m ignoring anybody who is taking this retirement personally and acting like this is the end of the fucking world. Um, I’m gonna say this right now, and I’m gonna say it again when we get to the match – I’m glad it’s over. And I know people that are getting offended by that. I’m glad it’s over. Look, I I can just – look, I fucking cried – I fucking cried – but it’s OK, it’s it’s not the end of the world. It’s not the end of the world. You can still watch wrestling, it’s not “oh, he retired; that’s it, I’m done, I can’t watch it anymore.” I mean, for God’s sakes, he was only there like – I mean, how many days are in a year? 365 days, so he was there one out of – c’mon. Three days. Four days. He made two appearances. I mean, I mean, OK, think about it like this: at Wrestlemania 31 he was there once the whole year, cause he was only there the day of Wrestlemania. So that’s one day of the year that you watched him, that year. So that’s, really? Are you really missing that much of wrestling by not having Undertaker there? I mean, come on. He’s my favorite wrestler, easily. Yeah, and he’ll be mine as well, but there does come a time when you have to go “look, it’s over”. I mean the guy – the guy – the guy can’t wrestle forever. I mean he’s – he was, 53? Yeah that was not -- he wrestled like a 75,000 year-old man. Yeah, when we get to that match I’m gonna be so critical on it. And I know people are gonna be pissed off at me. And I don’t care, I’m gonna call it like I see it, the rose colored glasses are off, the nostalgia is gone. Stop wanting the fucking 90s back, because the 90s are dead, get the fuck over it. Um, yeah. You people and your fucking 90s nostalgia, stop it. Let the 90s fucking die. Let it fucking die, please, just stop. Stop. Ugh. How’s your week been Alex? It’s been good, yeah. Um, it was – like, I don’t even remember – well, let me see. I forgot to mention, I guess I should mention this now. Ugh! Good time, better than never. This is actually not from this week but, let me see. When was this? Let me look at the calendar real quick on the computer. This would have been … not last week, but the week – no, not last week, not the week before that, but the week before that, on March 25th was my 29th birthday. And you’re just now letting us know? Well I belie- I think I was wished happy birthday by all of you on Facebook, so, that’s fine. But I didn’t – but I don’t think we’ve had a show since, cause we – cause we – cause we missed so many shows in a row. But uh, yeah, I put a video up on YouTube. We all drank a whole lotta shit. Um, I didn’t get drunk at all despite literally shotgunning I think six or seven shots of … was it tequila? .. yeah, I think it was like really really decent tequila, in a row. I didn’t feel anything. And some sake. But yeah, that’s up there on my YouTube channel, not that anybody ever goes on it. So uh, this week I don’t know, they added more DLC, the only DLC for King of Fighters. King of Fighters XIV. Did you say you liked Rock Howard? I forget. I don’t mind Rock Howard. Um I think he’s cool. I’ve always been an Andy Bogard, Terry Bogard … Well they’re already in the game, so. Yeah, I know. And I’m decent with Kim but I’m OK with Rock. Rock is now DLC for the game along with uh who else? Yamazaki. Is Iori in there or did they take him out? It’s Iori I think, or Yori? Tall guy with the fucking red hair. Not Rugal, but … No, I know who Rugal is. Madam Speaker, \"I solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, President of the United States, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws.\" That is the oath Senators swore on January 16. It is the oath created by Senators when they tried the first impeachment of a President in 1868. It is an oath rooted in the Revolution fought by their grandparents to create a republic of laws, not kings. It is an oath whose power derives from its common sense: that a juror must always be impartial for a trial to be fair. And it is an oath made necessary by the fact that Senators are not, as we are not, under normal circumstances, impartial in our work. The words chosen for this oath recognize that when our Constitution calls Senators to try impeachment, it calls them away from their role as partisans. When that oath is taken, Senators are supposed to step back from the affiliation of party or political kinship with or opposition to the President on trial. They are required, as the oath plainly states, to \"do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws.\" Madam Speaker, this afternoon, Senators will be asked to vote on the two Articles of Impeachment the House presented on abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. After voting to refuse to hear evidence and call witnesses with pertinent information, nearly all Republican Senators have already announced that they will vote against the articles. In doing so, many of them acknowledge that what President Trump did was wrong and inappropriate. They accept that it was wrong for him to withhold military aid to Ukraine until the President of that country promised to interfere in the American elections. The evidence of President Trump's abuse of power and attempt to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 elections is clear enough that Republican Senators cannot and have not denied the facts, yet they cannot bring themselves to confront this President and are choosing party over country. The Senator from Alaska, tried to deflect responsibility from the consequences of her actions I agree with that. She further said: \"It is sad for me today to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.\" Madam Speaker, the Congress has not failed. The House did its job, whether you agree or not. In regular order, by a vote of this House, we impeached the President of the United States based upon our oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. The House did its job and did so with the solemnity required when undertaking the process of impeachment, which we did not seek but accepted as our responsibility under the Constitution. We held hearings, called witnesses, and subpoenaed documents. Many of the witnesses and documents, of course, were withheld by the White House. It is the Senate . It is the Senate, Madam Speaker, that will fail . History will judge poorly those who choose fear of their party over the courage to do the right thing. Neither the Speaker nor myself, nor the whip, Jim Clyburn, urged any member in our party to vote any way on impeachment. There was no lobbying. There was no pressure. Our members voted consistent with their oath of office and the conviction that that vote was required by that oath to protect and defend the Constitution. Americans will judge. I am often asked why . It is because I know future generations will look back on this chapter in our history and ask: Who stood up for the Constitution and the laws? Who stood up for the values our Founders charged us to keep? Who refused to shrink from the heavy responsibilities of their oath? I can be proud that the House did its job, followed the law, defended our Constitution. We did not convict; that is not our role. Essentially, what we said was there was probable cause that powers had been abused and certainly cause to see that the President refused to cooperate with the constitutional responsibilities of the House of Representatives. I am also proud of the House managers, as all of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle are proud of our managers who made their case. They made their case with intellect. They made their case with evidence that had been adduced here in the House. They made their case and appealed to Senators to hold this President accountable, as our Founders intended. Almost everybody has watched a trial either in person or on television. A trial is not an opening argument and a closing argument with nothing in between. Seventy-five percent of our people wanted to have witnesses because that was their understanding of what a trial is, not just argument at the beginning and argument at the end, but evidence for jurors who have pledged to be impartial to consider. Any judge in this country would agree that opening and closing statements alone are not a trial. Nevertheless, the House managers proved their case. The truth is clear. The American people know what that truth is and know what this President has done. And they will remember who on this day abided by the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill, Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens: To a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion, and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence. The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place, and few of us stop . In the eyes of many in the world, this every 4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle. Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic. The business of our nation goes forward. These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people. Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, human misery, and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity. But it has not kept pace with public spending. For decades we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals. You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we're not bound by that same limitation? We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there be no misunderstanding: We are going to begin to act, beginning today. The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away . In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. Well, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden. The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price. We hear much of special interest groups. Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we're sick — professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truck drivers. They are, in short, \"We the people,\" this breed called Americans. Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs. All must share in the productive work of this \"new beginning,\" and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America, at peace with itself and the world. 1.1 What is Government? DIFFERENT TYPES OF GOVERNMENT The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power—influence over institutions, leaders, and policies—rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it, the law will be enacted. However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let’s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights. 4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy—the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government—some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot . At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Figure 1.5 Residents of Boxborough, Massachusetts, gather in a local hotel to discuss issues affecting their town. New England town meetings provide an opportunity for people to experience direct democracy. This tradition has lasted for hundreds of years. (credit: modification of work by Liz West) Most countries now have some form of representative government (Figure 1.6). 5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party’s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens’ lives. Citizens’ rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government. Figure 1.6 The map of the world shows the different forms of government that currently exist. Countries that are colored blue have some form of representative democracy. Countries that are colored red, like China, Vietnam, and Cuba, have an oligarchic form of government. Countries that are colored yellow are monarchies where the people play little part in governing. LINK TO LEARNING The CIA website provides information about the types of government across the world. Why the Division of Labor Increases Production workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons. First, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography affects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota , but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida . it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater . they will be more effective . Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better. A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its “core competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products. Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of his or her own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity. Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel. My name is Katie and today I'm going to be talking about my two and a half week long vacation to Portland, Oregon. So I am from Washington D.C., and I have a bunch of family in Portland, Oregon, so it wasn't my first time going there. Um but it was definitely my first time, like as an adult. So that was really exciting and fun. I thought that I would make sort of like more of an informative video because I could just like post a vlog, but um the footage was like so random, and all over the place. I got some really cool footage but um, not like cute like Instagram girl footage, because I did dress like a 12 year old boy the whole time. So the first thing that I recommend you do in Portland is not actually in Portland at all. So you might be like this is a terrible list. Sorry. The number one thing that we did on our trip was we actually stayed a night in Eugene, Oregon, and we got up at like the crack of dawn and drove to Crater Lake. This was incredible. Um one of the coolest things that I have ever seen. The footage that I'm gonna put in here honestly it looks a little bit fake. This place was incredible. We didn't do a whole lot of hiking here because there was not a whole lot of cloud coverage that day, and it was so hot. So what we did was we drove around the entire perimeter of the lake and you get all these incredible views of the mountains and the lake, and seeing it from all the different angles was so worth it. So maybe this is not something that you want to do but it's definitely something to consider . Number two is shopping. These are in no particular order by the way. They're just sort of like what I thought of as I was making this video. So there's a lot of cool shopping in Portland, Oregon. A lot of cool thrifting and vintage stores, a lot of cool art galleries. And then one of the biggest things that you should check out while you're there is Powell's which is a bookstore. And I want to say it's like the the biggest like Indie Indie bookstore in America. I guess that's what it's called. I'm gonna – oh, it's the world's largest independent bookstore. So this place was so cool we could have spent hours in here. The best thing that I thought about this bookstore was that they mixed in new copies of books with used copies. So like it's usually right next to it. That was very exciting for me because I love a used book. So I am not a huge like nature person. Um I don't enjoy bugs. But um I will go on a good hike from now and again so just like you know where I'm coming from. My friend Andrea is a biology major so we did stop to look at many slugs that were on the ground and I did beeline it away from the slugs. But if you like slugs, you're in – you're in luck. So the first couple days we were in Portland, we went hiking in Forest Park which you can get to by public transit in the city. It's really quick and some of the trails even pop you back out into like the city, so it's – it's really super accessible. So we did the Wildwood Trail and we also did a tour of Pittock Mansion. Um I'd still recommend like taking the trail up there . Um I loved doing that. So number four are the Japanese gardens and the rose gardens in Forest Park. I actually don't know if they're like technically in Forest Park but they're right in the same area. So the rose garden is free and open to the public and it is just huge. It's a lot of roses as you can imagine. Um lots of tourists but it was – it was still really fun. You get to walk through all these gardens and different types of roses from different parts of the world and yeah it was just really cool. Then the Japanese gardens you do have to pay for but I will say that it was definitely worth it. you can actually see Mount Hood from the Japanese gardens , and the garden was just so pretty and quiet and serene. There were even some people like meditating in there which was kind of funny. I did wear my bird shirt – It's a pretty good bird shirt, I got a compliment on it – which I didn't say this earlier, but I bought this at the Audubon Society which I learned what that was. I didn't know what that was but it's um a society for um like bird watching and bird care and um they had a shirt that said bird nerd on it so I bought it because I thought it was funny. But I was approached by – I want to say – at least three different people who asked me if I did bird watching like very seriously. What's up YouTube? So we are going to do a week of me vlogging. It's kind of an interesting week. I bounced around here and there, so I have to kind of show you guys around and show you what it's all about, and today I'm on general nuclear medicine, so let's start the day. So like I said, I'm on my general nuclear medicine rotation this week. I get switched around -- moved around a few times to cover some residents who are on vacation, so I'll be at other spots later this week. So so far this morning I've just read a few studies (it's a little slow in the morning) of general nuclear medicine . So I've done three lymphoscintigraphies. For lymphoscintigraphies we basically inject technetium in skin surrounding a melanoma and we wait about 15-20 minutes, maybe up to an hour, and wait . What we do is we mark it under our cameras and then the patient will go up to the OR, have the melanoma, a wide excision of the melanoma, and then they will try to find the lymph node that we marked and take that one out as well to make sure there's no metastasis. So I've done three of those this morning. I will read a few more scans coming up here shortly and just trying to tie up some loose ends before I go to conference. I'll check back in afterwards. Ah, the sun feels so good on the face. I'm officially done. It is about 4:00 p.m. We get to head home early today , and I'm gonna go home and work out . But I'm gonna go work out, cook something for dinner and do this all over again tomorrow. We're on a different rotation tomorrow so stay tuned to find out which one. Alright it is day two. It is Tuesday and today I got pulled to ultrasound. Yes, I don't know why I got pulled on today, but I did, so probably just sit in there, read some ultrasounds and get out early. I need to film another YouTube video. Alright so I've been here just crushing ultrasounds, and today I've been feeling a little under the weather so I've been, like, yeah, I've been like crushing these all day today and then I'll show you what else I've been. I picked these up when I was in Amsterdam for ... I got sick when I was on Croatia for vacation. I have no idea what it says, but I think they're cough drops, so if anybody knows what this says let me know. But I'm pretty sure it's just cough drops with some vitamin C in it. So this is what I have been doing all day is crushing ultrasounds and having Dutch cough drops. So if anybody speaks Dutch tell me what that means. Oh and PS, I usually try to avoid taking medicines that I can't read the name of but I had someone help me at the pharmacy in the airport. She spoke a little bit of English and I think those are actually cough drops, so, that's the only reason I'm still eating them today. You can tell by my voice it's a little on the sore side today so hopefully I get better because, I haven't told you guys yet, but I'm going somewhere this weekend and it's gonna be fun. Now it's time to get back to work. So I'm officially going home right now. Yeah, normally I would go home and work out, especially since it's, like, a beautiful day I would probably go running. But since I feel kind of crappy today I'm just going to go home, hang out, rest (ambulance was a little loud sorry). So I'm probably just gonna go home and rest and I have to get my hair cut today for my big trip coming up. But you still don't know where I'm going. But yeah that's pretty much it, hope you guys don't mind this kind of like random vlog that I'm doing, but I just wanted to show you guys kind of loosely like how a week is and the life of a radiology resident. So hopefully you guys find it somewhat interesting, and if you do I'll keep doing it. So heading home now. Athens (Greek: Αθήνα, Athína), is the capital city of Greece with a metropolitan population of 3.7 million inhabitants. It is in many ways the birthplace of Classical Greece, and therefore of Western civilization. Understand Old Athens The first pre-historic settlements was constructed in 3000 BC around the hill of Acropolis. The legend says that the King of Athens, Theseus unified the ten tribes of early Athens into one kingdom (c. 1230 BC). This process of synoikismos – bringing together in one home – created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility. By the 7th century BC, social unrest had become widespread, and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new law code (hence \"draconian\"). When this failed, they appointed Solon, with a mandate to create a new constitution (594). This was the great beginning of a new social revolution, which was the result of the democracy under Clisthenes (508 BC). During the Middle Ages, Athens experienced a decline, but re-emerged under Byzantian rule. Athens was thriving and prosperous during the Crusades, actually benefiting from the Italian trade during this period. However, this fruitful period was short-lived, as Greece suffered badly under the Ottoman Empire, only to recover in the 19th century as the capital of independent Greece. Modern Olympic Games Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. While most of the sporting venues were located outside the city proper - in various locations throughout Attica - the entire urban area of Athens underwent major lasting changes that have improved the quality of life for visitors and residents alike. Aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 Olympics (from new freeways to light rail systems), the city's historic center underwent serious renovation. Most notable among the city's facelift projects are the Unification of Archaeological Sites - which connects the city's classical - era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets - and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical Thissio and Pláka districts. The ancient Olympic Games took place in Olympia from 776 BCE to 394 AD. It is a lengthy day trip from Athens to visit Olympia, but quite interesting. Architecture Athens was just a small provincial village when it was chosen in the 1830s to serve as the national capital of the modern Greek State. the city's political, economic, and cultural importance had declined over the centuries. With the decision to move the national capital from Nafplio to Athens, architects and city planners were hired . The city regained its importance in Greek civilization, and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city, with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation's past. The 20th century however, marked the rapid development of Athens. The city suffered minor damage during WWII, and suffered extensive urban planning in the decades that followed, as the nation rapidly industrialized and urbanized. In the 1960s and 1970s, many 19th century neoclassical buildings, often small and private, were demolished to make way for office buildings, often designed by great Greek architects. The city also expanded outward through rash development, particularly towards the west. With the onset of the automobile, public officials reduced the city's public transportation services without foreseeing the traffic gridlock and smog that would menace the city by the 1980s. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city's reality led to a rude awakening among local and national officials and, coupled with the country's new found remarkable prosperity, large scale projects began to slowly regenerate the city and undo some of the damages of recent decades. Over the course of the next 15 years, money was poured into new transportation infrastructure projects, the restoration of surviving neoclassical buildings, the gentrification of the city's historical center and the renovation of many former industrial areas and the city's coastline. The restoration of charming neoclassical buildings in the city's historical center has been accompanied by the construction of attractive post-modern buildings in newer districts; both of which have begun to improve the aesthetic essence of the city. Athens today is ever evolving, forging a brand new identity for the 21st century. Climate Spring and late autumn are the best times to visit Athens. Summer can be extremely hot and dry during heatwaves, but this rarely happens. Winter is definitely low season, with the occasional rainy or snowy day, but also an ideal time to save money while enjoying the city without countless other travelers and tourists. Whilst peak traffic hour can be a bit smoggy on the main roads, on most sunny days the skies are azure blue. The main reason attributed for the pollution of Athens is because the city is enclosed by mountains in a basin which does not let the smog leave. The government's ban on diesel vehicles within Athens and the early 1990s initiatives to improve car emissions have greatly contributed to better atmospheric conditions in the basin. Coron Coron is in the province of Palawan, Philippines on Busuanga Island. It is the largest town on the island and has the largest share of accommodations. Background Coron is both the name of the largest town on the island of Busuanga, and the name of a different, smaller island just offshore. The area is famous for its World War II wreck diving, and the site has been named in many lists of top dive spots in the world. In September 1944, a fleet of Japanese ships hiding in the harbor were sunk in a daring raid by the US navy. The result is around ten well preserved underwater shipwrecks surrounded with coral reef. There are also attractions on Coron Island itself. There are many beautiful white sand beaches, mostly tiny and surrounded by large limestone cliffs and wildlife. Barracuda and Kayangan lakes are both stunning locations, and good for snorkeling, and the island is the ancestral domain of an indigenous tribe who are managing the island in a sustainable way and keeping outsiders at a distance and offshore at night. History The first inhabitants of Coron were the Tagbanuas who belong to the second wave of Indonesians who migrated to this area some 5,000 years ago. They were a nomadic, seafaring people, living mainly by fishing and subsistence agriculture. Although they are now sedentary (with the young using cell phones, etc.), they maintain many of their old customs, traditions and beliefs. Today, the Tagbanuas remain the dominant if not entire population of Coron. In 1902 that Coron was registered as a town and the name of the town was officially changed from Penon de Coron to Coron. From 1939 to the outbreak of World War II, the municipality experienced the mining boom. Labor shifted from farming to mining. In July 1942 the Japanese occupied the mining camps and resumed operation of the manganese mines. On September 24, 1944, a group of Japanese ships were sunk by American warplanes in Coron waters as the ships retreated from Manila Bay. To this day, about 10 or 12 of these World War II Japanese shipwrecks comprise what is considered one of the best dive sites in the world. In 1947, large scale deep sea fishing was introduced to Coron, and the town experienced another boom, a fishing boom. The population increased. On June 17, 1950, Busuanga was officially created as a separate municipality from Coron and in 1954, Coron was further reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Linapacan. On September 12, 1992, Coron was finally reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Culion. In the past, Coron was virtually unknown outside of Palawan. It remains a small, quaint fishing town with laid back charm but with increasing media exposure it is growing, slowly but steadily, Coron has taken an important position in the tourism industry. In the past decade, there has been a rapid influx of scuba divers and other tourists coming in, making tourism the major industry player in Coron today. How to Tell a Joke Two Parts: Getting the Material Right Getting the Delivery Right From one-liners to classic three-liners to the one-minute gag you tell your friends, a good joke pleases everyone. Joke-telling is one of the best ways to ease tension, make a new friend, or light up a room. That is, of course, if you can get a laugh. Telling good jokes is an art that comes naturally to some people, but for others it takes practice and hard work. Part 1 of 2: Getting the Material Right Know your audience. All aspects of the joke you tell, from the content to the length, need to be suited to your audience. What’s funny to a group of 20-year old college students may be very different from what makes your 70-year old-uncle laugh (then again, maybe not). Everyone’s an individual, so there are no hard and fast rules. But, unless you personally know the members of your audience, here are some good rules of thumb to follow: elderly people won’t like crude jokes; stay away from misogynist jokes if you’ve got an audience full of women; people of a specific ethnic or racial group won’t enjoy jokes making fun of their group; and jokes requiring specialized knowledge (of, for example, science or old movies) will only be appreciated by people who possess that knowledge. the better . Choose great material. You can find fodder lots of places — from your life, joke files online, by repurposing jokes you’ve heard in the past, and so on. You may want to start your own joke file. You can write your jokes down on index cards to keep them handy or use a document file on your computer. [1] The latter option may allow for easier revision. Decide on a target. Every joke has a “target,” which is what the joke is about. It’s important that the joke’s target (the most basic element of your material) be suited to your audience. Make sure it’s a target your audience will be interested in and something they’re likely willing to laugh at. [2] For example, husbands are likely to laugh at jokes about wives and vice versa; students will typically find jokes about school and teachers humorous. Have a realistic but exaggerated setup. The opening of the joke — or setup — should have a basis in the real world , but it should also include exaggeration . [3] Think of the setup as the foundation of a story. It’s a fundamental part of the joke; if you don’t lay a good foundation here, then the punchline won’t make sense to the audience or they won’t find it humorous. Your setup needs to be both realistic and exaggerated in order to be funny — it’s placing these two incongruous elements side by side that makes the joke funny. [4] The exaggeration can be slight or considerable — it just depends on the individual joke. Surprise with the punchline. The ending of the joke is obviously crucial. This is where the payoff comes in, what makes the joke succeed or fail. If you want to make the audience laugh, your punchline needs to be surprising. Some jokes also have what is called a tag or topper, which is an additional punchline. The tag builds on the original punchline or twists back on it in a surprising way. Make the joke your own. Lots of jokes rehash the same ground and sometimes they retell a story countless other jokes have told. it has to surprise the audience in some way. One way to personalize a joke is to change the ending. [5] Another option is to dress the joke up as a story about your own life. This will make a familiar joke unrecognizable. It may also make it particularly interesting if your audience is your friend(s). [6] Know your material. Practicing your joke is crucial. You don’t need to have it completely memorized — in fact, you \"shouldn’t\" memorize it — but you need to be really comfortable with it, so comfortable . Memorized jokes sound wooden. Good jokes have a lot of details and personality, so don’t be afraid to embellish. [7] Try different things out and see what feels right, what sounds best. Don’t use a joke until you’re completely comfortable with it. Try recording your joke on a tape player and playing it back to yourself. If you hear a lot of awkward pauses or “ah”s or “um”s, your joke isn’t ready and you need to practice more. [8] You can also try practicing in front of a sympathetic friend or family member once you’re ready for a “real” audience. How to Wash Overalls in a Washing Machine Whether you are a working man or just a little cutie trying to stay cute, those overalls are going to need washing sooner or later. The straps on adults’ overalls often get so twisted during the wash that one wishes she had just used an old fashioned washboard instead. Your appliances are also murder on the straps, which are almost always the first things to wear out on your overalls. This article will show you how to save time and prevent wear. Steps Wash alone or with \"like\" clothing. It’s best to wash adults’ overalls alone, especially men’s. However, it is okay to wash just a few items with them, like blue jeans. What you don’t want to wash with them is anything that can get twisted up with the straps, like women’s long sleeve shirts or kids’ blankets. Think similar clothing, minus the twisty-ness. Just do the denim and canvas stuff together. Fasten the straps to the bib. If you didn’t know already, the bib is the top front part with the breast pockets. Go ahead and fasten both straps before you wash. This will help keep them from twisting up during the wash. Use twist ties to keep the straps fastened. This step will reapportion years of your life in the long run. Don’t skip it. Take the 20 seconds . it will undo those straps in a heartbeat and tie them in a sheet bend . All it takes is two twist ties and a few seconds of patience. Empty the pockets. Overalls have more pockets than pants. The bib has a wallet pocket and a watch pocket. Kids put rocks, candy, and bugs in these. Men put cell phones and small tools in them. Women defy the laws of purse-space, so when it comes to bib pockets, the sky is the limit. Make sure all the pockets are empty. Move the strap adjusters around. You’ve probably got them just the way you like them, but if you move the adjusters up or down on the straps occasionally, the straps will last longer. Depending on the adjusters, you may be able to leave them a little loose too. The straps wear out fastest around the adjusters over the course of numerous wash and dry cycles (not to mention being out in the elements if they are work clothes). Moving them distributes the wear and tear of washing. This is the same idea as rotating tires. You know about rotating your tires, don't you? Tips If you wash your overalls alone or in a light load, use about half the detergent called for and less water. Leave the straps fastened and twist-tied to the bib when you throw them in the dryer. This will cut down on some of the racket, but you're still going to hear them. Warnings The paper-type twist ties will deteriorate a little, but the dryer filter screen will catch the fallout. Plastic-type twist ties will hold up in the wash, but may or may not melt in your dryer. Use with caution. \n",
